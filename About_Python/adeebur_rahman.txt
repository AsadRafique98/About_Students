My name is Adeebur Rahman. I prefer to be called Adeeb instead. I am currently in my last semester as a computer science major. In the past few semesters I have been taking various computer science electives at Hunter to broaden my skills. I'm looking for something intersting to focus on in the long term. I'm interested in learning more about pythong this semester.
