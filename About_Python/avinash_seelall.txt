Hi there my name is Avinash Seelall. I only used python so far in 127 and I hope to learn more about it. I've used it occasionally for small side projects but nothing major enough to put on my resume, mostly stuff for fun. I hope that I can give this class my all and be confident in my Python skills by the end. I want to get into either AI, data science or cyber security. That is my mission.
