Hi, my name is Alan Yu and I am currently a senior at Hunter College studying
computer science. My dream is to find a tech job in the future but right
now I'm not quiet sure what I want to do. Some of my hobbies include typical
nerd stuff like playing videogames, watching tv and movies but I also enjoy
watching sports like basketball or American football. A dream vacation would be 
going into outer space because Earth is boring.
