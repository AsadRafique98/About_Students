My name is Emily Fang and I am currently a senior majoring in Computer Science and minoring in Mathematics. 
I tend to have many hobbies that I rotate through so I am a jack-of-trades and master of none in a sense.
In terms of instruments, I play the paino, ukulele, kalimba, and acousitc guitar for fun.
In terms of creative hobbies, I draw, paint, knit, sew, and many other things that I can't remember.
All in all, I have a lot of homebody hobbies; however, I also like to be active as well.
I enjoy rock climbing and working out in my free time to relieve stress, stay healthy, and improve my mental health.

In terms of work, I have found opportunities once I graduate. I am currently also up to team matching for Google, like the professor.
