My name is Henry Andrew Baum

I'm currently a senior at Hunter College, majoring in Computer Science
and minoring in Mathematics (despite being terrible at it). Most of my professional
experience with software engineering and development has been creating full-stack
web apps, using popular frameworks such as React, Flask, Django, and Express. Lately,
I've been working on the expand my experience by introducing Android App development,
and was able to create a full stack Android app for my capstone project.

As this is my last semester at Hunter (fingers crossed), my plans afterwards aren't
as clear as I would want them to be, but I'm hoping to land a job or contract work
that I would be able to contribute my knowledge and skills as well presented
opportunities to expand into other fields such as data mining or machine learning.

Outside of that, I'm a licensed massage therapist for New York City for over ten years.
My hobbies include creating electronic music, playing rouge-like video games, and
enjoy watching professional wrestling.
