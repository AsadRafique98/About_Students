I'm Lauren and I am a Computer Science major.

I completed a major in Classical Studies,
as well as minors in Psychology and Sociology.

At the start of the pandemic, I learned how to make interactive,
game-style "filters" on Instagram using JavaScript,
and the first one I made, "Never Have I Ever," went viral.
(It has now been opened 20.9M times!)

Soon after, Comedy Central and Wikipedia
commissioned me to make them similar versions,
and since then, I've been a freelance AR developer.
