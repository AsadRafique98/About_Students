  Hello, my name is Yongjun Na. I am currently a senior majoring in computer science at Hunter College. I aspire to become a software developer, but feel like I am late to the game compared to most students because I switched to cs not too long ago. I hope to graduate and be able to find a job without much problem and be happy. I hope to learn a lot through this class this semester and am looking forward to it!
