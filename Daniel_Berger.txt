My name is Daniel Berger and I have been coding on and off for a few years. I am going through a career change from the medical field. Recently I've been getting more into Block Chain Dev and would probably like to focus in this area, as it is interteresting and new and love the direction that Web3 is heading. I love to travel and have been to many countries in Europe, and Asia. My favorite vacation was Japan and would love to go back soon and maybe do some remote work from there.
